# ianblenke/taps

My customized Homebrew taps. Mostly for the latest versions of docker things, at the moment.

To use these taps, you can either:

    brew install ianblenke/taps/docker
    brew install ianblenke/taps/docker-compose
    brew install ianblenke/taps/docker-machine

or you can `brew tap` and install them as normal formulas:

    brew tap ianblenke/taps
    brew install docker docker-compose docker-machine

These are a work in progress. YMMV.
